To do: reduce frosting as it currently makes too much for the cake

Equipment:
    • Mixing bowls, 3
    • Saucepan
    • Whisk
    • Rubber spatula
    • Cake pan or pans
    • Cooking oil
    • Oven
    • Stove
    • Cake spatula or butter knife
Wet:
    • Eggs, 4
    • Sugar, 1⅓ Cups
    • Pumpkin, 2½ Cups, puréed

Dry:
    • Flour, 1⅓ Cup
    • Salt, 1 tsp
    • Cinnamon, 2 tsp, ground
    • Baking Soda, 2 tsp

Frosting:
    • Flour, ⅓ Cup
    • Sugar, ⅔ Cup
    • Salt, ¼ tsp
    • Milk, 1 Cup
    • Butter, 4 Tbs
    • Cream Cheese, 3 oz
    • Vanilla Extract, 1 tsp
    • Pumpkin Spice to taste

Mix wet ingredients. Mix dry ingredients. Fold dry ingredients into wet. Pour batter into oiled cake pan(s).
Bake at 350°F for 25 minutes or until a knife in the thickest part of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool while you prepare the frosting.

Mix flour, sugar, and salt in a saucepan. Add milk and cook on medium-low heat until thickened considerably.
This took me about 10 minutes constantly stirring with a whisk. Allow to cool. Beat butter, cream cheese, vanilla, and spices in a bowl.
Beat in milk mixture a little at a time. Spread on cake(s).

Serve cold, refrigerate when not in use.
