For bread:
Line loaf pan with parchment paper on 3 sides, spray 2 remaining sides with cooking oil. Pour batter into loaf pan. Bake in oven at 350°F (176°C) for about 55 minutes or until a knife/toothpick stuck into the thickest part comes out clean. Remove bread from pan, let cool, slice and serve with butter. 

For cookies (untested):
