Salsa is pretty easy. You just need RGOGSH. Here's an example of one recipe following the RGOGSH formula.


1 peach
2 jalapeños
4 baby bell peppers
½ medium onion
2 medium tomatoes
cilantro
2 cloves garlic (or garlic powder)
salt

Dice all. Mix. Blend half of mix.
Combine diced & blended parts. Add spices. Serve fresh or chilled with tortilla chips.
